==========

This project is a complete implementation of the _jlox_ interpreter from Robert Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), reimagined using the idiomatic power of **Rust**.

🎯 Project Overview
-------------------

This repository contains a tree-walk interpreter that processes the Lox language - a dynamically typed, interpreted scripting language. While the original book uses Java, this implementation leverages Rust’s modern systems programming features to build a robust and efficient execution engine.

### Why Rust?

First of all, it’s interesting. As a web developer, I want to learn Rust because of its strong connection to WebAssembly and the opportunities that come with it. Exploring WASM helps me better understand performance, memory, and execution beyond the browser, which I believe makes me a better developer overall.

🚀 Roadmap
